Adds the Share on Orkut button at the end of each post.

== Description ==
The plugin adds a "Share on Orkut" button at the end of each post.

It uses the recently released [Share API](http://code.google.com/apis/orkut/docs/orkutshareapidoc.html) by Orkut.

This plugin was originally made for [OrkutPlus](http://www.orkutplus.net).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I disable the plugin on particular a post or page? =
Please add `no_orkut_share` in post/page meta with the value `1`

= Can users edit or delete the content, once they have shared it? =
Yes. This content will appear in the 'My updates' section, which users can delete anytime. If the content is promoted, they can pause or delete it from the 'My promotions' section.

= Are users and friends guaranteed to see the shared content from my site? =
Users can share content with their friends. However, some of those friends may not see the shared content because there are limits on the activities that show up by default and the number of promotions that can be sent.

= How do I get statistics of how many users shared out of my site? =
At this time there are no analytics and reports offered to website publishers for this feature. You can look at URL params from your own weblogs to see the level of shared activity.
